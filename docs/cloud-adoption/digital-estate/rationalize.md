# Fusion: How can a full inventory be rationalized to divide resources across the 5 Rs of rationalization?

Cloud Rationalization is the process of evaluating assets to determine the best approach to hosting the asset in the cloud.
Once an [approach](approach.md) has been determined and [inventory](inventory.md) has been aggregated, Cloud Rationalization can begin. The [5 Rs of rationalization](5-rs-of-rationalization.md) discusses the most common rationalization options.

## Traditional view of rationalization 

It's easy understand rationalization, when visualizing the traditional process of rationalization like a complex decision tree. Each asset in the digital estate is feed through a process that results in one of five answers. For small estates a complete rationalization, this process works well. For larger estates, its not very efficient and can lead to significant delays. Lets examine the process to see why.

For a streamlined, more modern approach to rationalization, check out the article on [Incremental Rationalization](rationalize-incremental.md).

**Inventory:** A thorough inventory of assets, including applications, software, hardware, operating systems, and system performance metrics is required to complete a full rationalization using traditional models.

**Quantitative analysis:** In the decision tree, quantitative questions drive the first layer of decisions. Common questions would include things like: Is the asset in use today? If so, is it optimized and sized properly? What dependencies exist between assets? These questions are vital to classification of the inventory.

**Qualitative analysis:** The next wave of decisions require human intelligence in the form of qualitative analysis. Often times, these questions are unique to the solution and can only be answered by business stakeholders and power users. These decisions are where the process is generally delayed, slowing things down considerably. This analysis generally consumed 40-80 FTE hours per application. For guidance on building a list of Qualitative analysis questions, see the article on [Approach](approach.md) or the specific rationalization target in the article on the [5 Rs of Rationalization](5-rs-of-rationalization.md).

**Rationalization Decision:** In the hands of an experienced rationalization team, the qualitative and quantitative data creates clear decisions. Unfortunately, teams with a high degree of rationalization experience are expensive to hire and/or take months to train. For an alternative approach consider the article on [incremental rationalization](rationalize-incremental.md).

## Rationalization at Enterprise Scale

If this effort is time consuming and daunting for a 50 VM digital estate, imagine the effort required to drive business transformation in an environment with 1,000 VMs and hundreds of applications. The human effort required can easily exceed 1,500 FTE hours and 9 months of planning.

While full rationalization is the end state and a great direction to move towards, it seldom produces a high ROI relative to the time and energy required.

When rationalization is essential to financial decisions, it is worth considering a professional services organization that specializes in cloud rationalization to accelerate the process. Even then, full rationalization can be a costly and time-consuming effort that could delay transformation or business outcomes.

See [Incremental Rationalization](rationalize-incremental.md) for an alternative approachâ€¦

## Next steps

The output of a rationalization effort is a prioritized backlog of all assets to be impacted by the chosen transformation.

This backlog is now ready to serve as the foundation for [costing models of cloud services](calculate.md).
