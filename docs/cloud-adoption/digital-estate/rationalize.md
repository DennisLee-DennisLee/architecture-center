# Fusion: How can a full inventory be rationalized to divide resources across the 5 Rs of rationalization?

Cloud Rationalization is the process of evaluating assets to determine the best approach to hosting the asset in the cloud.
Once an [approach](approach.md) has been determined and [inventory](inventory.md) has been aggregated, Cloud Rationalization can begin. The [5 Rs of rationalization](5-rs-of-rationalization.md) discusses the most common rationalization options.

## Traditional view of rationalization - Planning Plinko

It's easy understand rationalization, when visualizing the traditional process of rationalization like a giant Plinko board. At the top are all of the assets in the digital estate. Those assets are feed through a process that results in one of five answers for each Plinko chip. For small estates like the one pictured, this works well. For larger estates, its not very efficient and can lead to significant delays. Lets examine the process to see why.

For a streamlined, more modern approach to rationalization, check out the article on [Incremental Rationalization](rationalize-incremental.md).

**Inventory:** Very few organizations invest the time, energy, and expense to maintain an accurate, real-time inventory of the full digital estate. Loss, theft, refresh cycles, and employee on-boarding often justify detailed asset tracking of end user devices. However, the return on investment (ROI) of maintaining an accurate server and application inventory in a traditional, on-prem DataCenter is often low. Most IT organizations have other more pressing issues to address that produce greater returns than tracking the usage of fixed assets in a DataCenter.

In a Cloud Transformation, inventory has a direct correlation on operating costs. Accurate inventory data is required for proper planning. Unfortunately, current environmental scanning options can delay decisions by weeks or months, to scan and catalog the full inventory.

**Quantitative analysis:** In the image above, each black peg represents a quantitative question: Is the asset in use today? If so, is it optimized and sized properly? What dependencies exist between assets? These questions are vital to classification of the inventory.

**Qualitative analysis:** Each red peg is a question that requires human intelligence or qualitative analysis. Often times, these questions are unique to the solution and can only be answered by business stakeholders and power users. These pegs tend to jam up the process, slowing things down considerably. This analysis generally consumed 40-80 FTE hours per application. For guidance on building a list of Qualitative analysis questions, see the article on [Approach](approach.md).

**Rationalization Decision:** In the hands of an experienced rationalization team, the qualitative and quantitative data creates clear decisions. Unfortunately, teams with a high degree of rationalization experience are expensive to hire and/or take months to train. For an alternative approach review the article on [incremental rationalization](rationalize-incremental.md).

## Rationalization Plinko at Enterprise Scale

If this effort is time consuming and daunting for a 50 VM digital estate, imagine the effort required to drive business transformation in an environment with 1,000 VMs and hundreds of applications. The human effort required can easily exceed 1,500 FTE hours and 9 months of planning.

While full rationalization is the end state and a great direction to move towards, it seldom produces a high ROI relative to the time and energy required.

When rationalization is essential to financial decisions, it is worth considering a professional services organization that specializes in cloud rationalization to accelerate the process. Even then, full rationalization can be an effort in futility.

See [Incremental Rationalization](rationalize-incremental.md) for an alternative approachâ€¦

## Next steps

The output of a rationalization effort is a prioritized backlog of all assets to be impacted by the chosen transformation.

This backlog is now ready to serve as the foundation for [costing models of cloud services](calculate.md).
